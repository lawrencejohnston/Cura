The Cura project planner is a tool to facilitate printing more then 1 object at a time. Some tools call this a "virtual table" or "platter". However, Cura's project planner has a few more advanced features.

==Tutorial 1 - Basic planning==
[[Image:attention.png]] ``Note: This tutorial assumes you have an Ultimaker, without modifications. If you modified the fan shrout, you might need to configure the head size.``

For this tutorial, we are going to print the [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27257 Pocket Tactics by DutchMongul] set in as few jobs as possible.

First, goto the thingiverse page of [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27257 Pocket Tactics], and download the following files:

``Note: No need to download the rest of the files, as they are included in the legionhighking.stl``

Next, open the project planner from the file menu in normal mode:
[[Image:pp/openmenu.png]]

You will be greeted with the following window:
[[Image:pp/projectplannerMain.png]]
The center area with the squares is your build platform, on the right you have the emtpy white box which will contain your files. And then there are a lot of buttons and options.

We'll begin by creating the Druid army, as you need to print those all in the same color.
Now press the one of the add buttons. Both act the same, and you can use the one you like most.
[[Image:pp/addButton.png]]

In the file selection window, select all the files of the Druid army. You can select multiple files by holding down the [CTRL] button on your keyboard.
[[Image:pp/druidArmySelect.png]]
``Note: After pressing 'Open' it can take a while to load these files, als they are quite detailed.``

After adding the files, you can see all the models are standing in the front left corner, on top of eachother.
[[Image:pp/druidArmy1.png]]

You can move them manually, but a much easier option is the 'Auto place' button. Once again, there are 2 buttons that do the same.
[[Image:pp/autoplace.png]]

As you can see, the army is now organized on the build platform.
[[Image:pp/druidArmy2.png]]
However, and Druid army has 3 stalkers, 2 marauders, 2 juggernauts and 2 witches. And there are only 1 of each on the platform now.

So, I present you, the "copy button":
[[Image:pp/copyButton.png]]

First, select the marauder, and press the copy button. Do the same for the juggernaut, and the witch. And copy the stalker twice.
``Note: Copying these models is a bit slow. They are extreemly detailed and cause some performance problems. Increasing performance is on the list in Cura's improvement program.``

After copying you can re-arrange the order of the items with the blue arrows. I personally like keep the same objects together, but any order works.

The locations on the platform are still wrong, as the copied objects intersect with the origonals. This is why some objects are colors in red right now. Once again, press the auto-place button.
[[Image:pp/druidArmy3.png]]

Now we are ready to slice this into a gcode file. Which can be done with the button next to the auto place buttons.
[[Image:pp/sliceButton.png]]

Save the GCode file as ''druidearmy.gcode''
[[Image:pp/saveGCode.png]]

The project planner will now prepare your GCode file:
[[Image:pp/buildingGCode.png]]

After preparation is done, you can print the resulting GCode file or copy it to an SD card for printing with the UltiController.
[[Image:pp/sliceDone.png]]

Finally, when printed, it should look something like this:
